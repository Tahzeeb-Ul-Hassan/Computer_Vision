# Computer Vision Projects & Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and project work in the field of Computer Vision. It includes practical code implementations, model experimentation, and key techniques widely used in image analysis and deep learning.



##  Contents

- Image classification 
- Object detection using pre-trained models (e.g., Faster R-CNN)
- Neural network training with different optimizers and parameters
- Experimentation with OpenCV and TensorFlow pipelines


## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV



## 🚀 Purpose

This repository helps me build and sharpen practical Computer Vision skills by working on real code, debugging model behavior, and analyzing results across different approaches and tools.
